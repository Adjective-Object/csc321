Neuron 43:
    goes low when there is a capital character at the beginning of a line, and
    stays low until it a newline is outputted

    Likely keeping track of if we are in a character name

    Doesn't seem to have an effect on adding spaces or newlines after ':',
    might be useful for part 4
    

Neuron 73:
    Goes high at the beginning of every line, and stays high when reading
    capital characters

    Goes low immediately following a colon, and it is attached to the
    newline character as an output, so it is likely a cause of newlining

Neuron 100:
    Goes high immediately following a colon, and has a high weight with both
    newline and space

Neuron 187:
    Goes low on strings of capital letters not beginning a line. This behavior
    is likely keeping track of if we are in a title.

    Goes high on the same time step as printing a colon, and is triggered by 
    a colon being high on the previous time step

    Also highly connected to newline, so its likely causing newlines following
    colons
 

 

-Goes negative when it sees US and back to positive to when it sees a colon
	-Looking for names
